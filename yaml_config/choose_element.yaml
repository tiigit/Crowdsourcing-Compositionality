  Which green part(s) in the diagram belongs together with the red part(s)?\n
  'Belonging together' means that some smaller parts of the diagram together form a meaningful bigger part or whole within the diagram.\n\n

  Select the point labeling tool [R] on the left sidebar.\n
  Place a point by clicking on the green parts of the diagram that you wish to choose.\n\n

  Only place a point within the chosen green parts: editing or removing outlines for any part will result in rejected work!"
